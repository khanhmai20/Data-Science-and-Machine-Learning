# Restaurant Profit Analysis

### Objective 
1. Matlab syntax practice
2. Visualizing data
3. Apply machine learning algorithm 
* Gradient Descent
* Linear Regression


### Implementation Overview

#### Visualizing Data
Suppose you are the CEO of a restaurant franchise and are considering different cities for opening a new outlet. The file ex1data1.txt contains the dataset for our linear regression problem. The first column is the population of a city and the second column is the profit of a food truck in that city. A negative value for profit indicates a loss.

#### Implementing Gradient Descent 
The application of gradient descent is to minimizing the cost which initialized by *thetas*.The implementation of Gradient Descent algorithm can be found in **GradientDescent.m** which is chained with **ComputeCost.m**. Therefore, the output indicates that the cost function is minimized
